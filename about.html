<p>I am currently facing a problem and since new to Angular. I need some more clarification on this. Does this mean that even if you changed your data in your service, the data still wont change because it has already been created? Because i created a factory service and i have removed all data from the function but it still returns the initial data in my controller. So does that means only the controller can be used then? What if i have a webservice that takes parameters to fetch data from an external source does it mean that even when the parameters change the results wouldnt change because it has already been created?</p>
